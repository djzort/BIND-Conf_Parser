NAME
    BIND-Conf_Parser - a module for parsing BIND version 8 named.conf files

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows a script to understand the contents of a BIND
    version 8 named.conf file.  Why would you want to parse your
    /etc/named.conf file?  Well, let's say you're a sysadmin and you've
    gotten tired of mismatches between your DNS forward and reverse
    zones, and you want a tool that'll check your zone files for
    inconsistencies and typos.  How's that tool going to get the
    complete list of zone files?  Tah da, enter this module, stage
    right!  The verify_zones script included with this module does
    exactly the above, and may even work at your site.

    Truth be told, finding zone files is all I currently use it for.
    However, it handles the complete syntax, so perhaps you can think
    of other users.

    The name of this module is perhaps not the best.  Suggestions
    are welcome.

    This revision matches BIND version 8.2.2.

THANKS
    The design of this module was inspired by Gisle Aas's HTML::Parser
    module.

REQUIREMENTS
    This module is known to work with perl-5.6.0, perl-5.005_02 and
    perl-5.005_03, and is believed to work with Perl5.004.  However, it
    is sensitive to changes in the semantics of the pos() function and
    /\G.../g matching.  Indeed, the 5.004 -> 5.005 upgrade broke an
    earlier version of this module.  You Have Been Warned.

    The parse() method requires that the IO::Scalar module from the
    IO-stringy kit be installed.

DOCUMENTATION
    The BIND::Conf_Parser module has been PODified, but good
    descriptions of the data structures are, well, missing.  The
    examples in the POD may be enough to get one started.

MISSING
    An automated test suite, for starters.  I 'test' this using the
    named.conf at where I work, but the coverage of that test is pretty
    poor.

    Support for the new statements supported by BIND 9.0.0 would be
    nice.
